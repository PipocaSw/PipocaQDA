# User

A _user_ is any person who uses PipocaQDA for whatever purpose.

The user object serves two purposes:

1. As part of an accountability trail, it allows a record to be kept of which user made which changes to a project.
2. For authentication purposes, it is used as part of a role-base access control ([RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)) system to ensure that operations are only carried out by those authorised to do so.
