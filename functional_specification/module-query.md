# Queries

The researcher uses _queries_ to extract information from the research data to support the analysis. Queries can be as simple as selecting part of the data based on simple criteria. More complex queries might be based on the intersection or union of different tagged fragments. In their most general form, queries can invoke arbitrary table joins, just like queries on relational databases.

- The query module should help the user to write queries, whether simple or complex.

- It should include a collection of common pre-defined queries that require only the completion of query parameters to run.

- It should include a query builder that guides the user in writing their own queries.

- It should have an ‘expert’ mode that allows the user to write a query from scratch.
