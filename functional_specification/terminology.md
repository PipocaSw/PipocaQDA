# Terminology

<a name="project"/>__Project__ A _project_ is a self-contained research projects. It comprises the research _sources_, the _qualities_ used to analyse that data, the _fragments_ associated those qualities, and the reporting performed on the research data.

<a name="source"/>__Source__ A _source_ is a single item of research data that forms part of a _project_. Typical examples include an interview transcript, photograph or newspaper article.

<a name="fragment"/>__Fragment__ A _fragment_ is a simple part of a source. For this purpose the definition of simple depends on the type of source; typical examples are a continuous chunk of text, a rectangular section of an image or a time-delimited interval of a video.

<a name="quality"/>__Quality__ A _quality_ is something that a researcher associates with _fragments_ of research data in the process of performing qualitative research. Users of other qualitative research software may know a quality as a _node_ or a _code_. We have chosen the term _quality_ for its clear connection with qualitative research, and the fact that it is not already used to mean many other things.
