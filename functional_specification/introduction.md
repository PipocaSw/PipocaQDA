# Introduction

This document provides a functional specification for the PipocaQDA software. It describes the data structures that underpin the software, and the functions that a user of the software is able to perform.

As a functional specification, its purpose is to guide the formulation of an implementation specification. It specifies what users of the software must be able to do without necessarily providing a precise description of how they will be able to do it.
